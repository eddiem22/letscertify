# myEmail
A light and simple email application with a user friendly GUI.

This application is a relatively small and completely doable project that would give me more experience with AJAX, alongside exploring other new frameworks such as nodemailer. In addition, this would really help me gain a grasp on express.JS, as that is something I really need to touch up on.

**TO RUN YOU MUST TYPE THE FOLLOWING:

************************************************
1. NPM INSTALL
2. NPM RUN START
************************************************

**YOU MUST ALSO GENERATE A ONE TIME APP PASSWORD FROM YOUR EMAIL HOST TO ENTER INTO THE PASSWORD FIELD IF REQURIED

**ELECTRON-APP BRANCH HAS ENTIRE APPLICATION EXCEPT THE DEPENDENCIES LISTED ABOVE
